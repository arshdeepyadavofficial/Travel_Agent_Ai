    "# IBM Watson AI Travel Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a travel AI assistant using IBM Watson AI. We'll explore key concepts including **Watson AI deployments**, **streaming API responses**, and **authentication mechanisms** while building a practical travel recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watson AI Deployment\n",
    "A **deployment** in IBM Watson represents a running instance of a machine learning model that can receive requests and return predictions or responses. Each deployment has:\n",
    "- **Deployment ID**: Unique identifier for the specific model instance\n",
    "- **Endpoint URL**: The API endpoint where requests are sent\n",
    "- **Model Configuration**: Settings that define how the model processes requests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming API\n",
    "Watson AI supports **streaming responses** where the AI generates content in real-time chunks rather than waiting for the complete response. This provides:\n",
    "- **Real-time feedback**: Users see responses as they're generated\n",
    "- **Better user experience**: Reduces perceived latency\n",
    "- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Uses the SSE protocol for continuous data streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Flow\n",
    "IBM Cloud uses **OAuth 2.0** with API keys:\n",
    "1. **API Key**: Your unique credential for accessing IBM Cloud services\n",
    "2. **Access Token**: Temporary token obtained using the API key\n",
    "3. **Bearer Authentication**: The access token is used in API requests"

However, as a general guide, a week-long trip for one person could range from approximately $1,500 to $3,000 USD, including accommodation, meals, transportation, and sightseeing.
